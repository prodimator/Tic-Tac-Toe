# Tic Tac Toe

## Building and running the program

I built this using React. It is required that you have npm installed in order to build and run the app.

1. cd into the repository directory
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

The app will open up at `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes/etc

1. Features include all of the basic rules and functions of Tic Tac Toe.
2. Player turns alternate placing their corresponding letter on the board.
3. If a player places their letter in a way that counts as a win, the game will announce that the player has won, stop the game, and increase their score.
4. After a player has won, the players can choose to continue playing another round or reset the board and score.
5. If no player wins after the board is filled, the match results in a tie and no one recieved a point.
6. If at any time the players wish to reset the board, there is an option to do so.
